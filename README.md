# hyper-parameter-tuning-for-validation-in-a-multi-layer-neural-netowork-titanic-data-set-
a small experiment to understand the behavior of the loss function and accuracy in the validation data set and tune different hyperparameters ( epoch , batchsize ,hidden layers , activation function) and store and plot them to visualize the behavior .

The process demonstrates : 
## data cleaning 
## feature engineering 
## model built
## initial performance evaluation
## hyper parameter tuning
